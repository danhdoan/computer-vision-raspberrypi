# OpenCV Docker for Raspberry Pi

OpenCV docker image for Raspberry Pi (arm32v7) can be pulled with:

`docker pull danhdoan/opencv4-slim-buster:3.7.9`

In this image, I built OpenCV 4.4.0 from source, and support Python 3 only (version 3.7.9) 

Image size: 907 MB (in later update, it will be smaller)
